# Mission Statement

DAOStack is a widely open collaboration to build the basic framework for [Decentralized Autonomous Organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) (DAO) through  bootstrap, or dogfooding. \\

Meaning, firstly publish the minimal smart contract that distributes tokens and voting power (AKA reputation) for further token distribution. Then, collectively distribute more tokens and voting power to contributors of code and other contributions, according to the appreciation of current reputation holders. Anyone who disagrees with the current reputation alignment can always open a new contract, with new token and reputation systems (and be the initial reputation holder). \\

Gradually, bit by bit, we aim to build the first decentralized corporation, an array of contracts that can hold the tokens and voting power of each other, interact and form a decentralized economy.
