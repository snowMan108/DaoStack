The DAOStack Roadmap
====================

DAOStack 0.1 (end of October)
------------
(Output from **DAOStack Workshop One**: Oct 19-23)

- Implementation will be in the form of a preliminary whitepaper draft only, no code.
- DAOStack tokens will be available for purchase via a preliminary crowdsale / ICO.
- The ICO will only accept eth, and will be capped (max funds collected in the crowdsale = cost of two large pizzas).


DAOStack 0.2 (Q4 2016)
----------------------
- A solid technical spec.
- The spec will undergo multiple, successful independent security audits by field experts. 

DAOStack 0.3 (Q1 2017)
----------------------
Deployed code on the Ethereum (ETH) network.
