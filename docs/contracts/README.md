Welcome to contracts documentation!

This directory includes manual markdown documentation for `contracts` directory.
It follows the directory structure of `contracts` (eg. file `foo/bar.md` documents the `bar` contract in `contracts/foo`).

Files in this folder will be included in `../generated_docs` (with `yarn docs update`) and merged with automatically generated docs (if available) based on their file name.
*Example: `foo/bar.md` will be merged with automated docs for the contract `bar` in the directory `contracts/foo/`*
