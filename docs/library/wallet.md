# Wallet API

## Wallet.new() => Wallet

`Wallet.new` will create a Ethereum wallet using the ethers.js library.
It uses bip39 to generate a mnemonic seed to generate the wallet deterministically.
The seed should never be shared with anyone.

Usage:

    let wallet = Wallet.new();

## Wallet.fromPrivateKey(privateKey: string) => Wallet

Creates a wallet from a private key

Usage:

    let wallet = Wallet.fromPrivateKey("0xXXXX...")

## async Wallet.fromEncrypted(encryptedJSON: string, password: string, progressCallback: (percentFinished) => any) => Wallet

Unencrypts a wallet from the encrypted JSON string generated by calling Wallet.new.
The progressCallback function will be called during the wallet unencryption process which can take several seconds, and will be passed
the percent finished encryption.

Usage:

    let wallet = Wallet.fromEncrypted(encryptedJSON, "password", (progress) => { console.log(progress); })


## Wallet.fromMnemonic(mnemonic: string) => Wallet

Generates/recovers a wallet from a mnemonic string.

Usage:

    let wallet = Wallet.fromMnemonic(mnemonic)

## async encrypt(password: string, progressCallback: (percentFinished) => any) => string

Encrypt the wallet using `password`. The `progressCallback` function will be called during the wallet encryption process which can take several seconds, and will be passed the percent finished encryption. Returns the encrypted Secret Storage JSON Wallet string.

Usage:

    let encryptedJSON = wallet.encrypt("passw0rd", (progress) => { console.log(progress); });

## async getEtherBalance(inWei = false) => string | BigNumber

Returns the ETH balance of the wallet either in Ether or in wei as a BigNumber. See https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/

## getMnemonic() => string | null

Returns the 12 word mnemonic string generated as part of `Wallet.new`. This will return null for Wallet objects created by `Wallet.fromEncrypted`

## async getOrgTokenBalance(organizationAvatarAddress : string, inWei = false) => string | BigNumber

Returns the wallet's balance of an Organization's token. This this defaults to the unit of the balance being Ether but passing inWei = true returns a BigNumber object with the balance in wei.

## getPublicAddress() => string

Returns the public address of the wallet

## async sendEther(toAccountAddress: string, numEther: number) => void

Sends ETH from the wallet to the public address toAccountAddress.
