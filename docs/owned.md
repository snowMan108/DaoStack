# Owned

Step 1 in the DAO stack.

## Description

Contract with an owner, ownership can be transfered (ownership will later be transfered to a “reputation contract”)

## Status

Done. 

## Remarks

It's just a standard contract.  Although this one's perhaps slightly more elegant: https://github.com/ethcore/contracts/blob/master/Owned.sol
